        Exciting news today! We’re launching a public changelog for
        <b>MrQuizer</b> so you can always stay up to date with the latest
        updates, improvements, and fixes. While we’re constantly working behind
        the scenes to enhance <b>MrQuizer</b>, we understand that it might
        sometimes feel like not much is changing. This changelog is here to
        bridge that gap and ensure transparent communication between us and you.
        Whenever we make changes to the widget, or update any feature, you'll
        get an instant notification. All changes will also be available on our
        public changelog page. Stay tuned for continuous improvements, brought
        to you by <b>Marnik</b>.
